# titanic-survival-exploration

## Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Project 0

In this optional project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data

### Install
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib


You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).


### Code
This project contains three files:

- titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb  
  This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- titanic_data.csv: The project dataset  
  You’ll load this data in the notebook.
- visuals.py  
  This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
  
### Run
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command:  
```jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb```
